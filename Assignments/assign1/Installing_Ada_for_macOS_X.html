<p><strong>Installing Ada on Mac OS X (Mountain Lion or later)</strong></p>

<p>To install Ada on your Mac, perform the following steps:</p>

<p>(1) In order to use GNU Ada (GNAT) on your Mac, you will need to have certain GNU utilities installed, such as &quot;make&quot; and &quot;gcc&quot;.&nbsp; If these are already on your computer, then you can skip to step (2).</p>

<p>Although you get make, gcc, etc. as part of XCode, which requires a 3.5GB&nbsp; download, it is sufficient just to download the XCode command line tools (which is a much smaller download).&nbsp; To do this, in a shell (e.g. the terminal application), type:</p>

<p>xcode-select --install</p>

<p>A window will pop up asking if you would like to install the command line tools. Click &quot;Install&quot; and the command line tools will be installed.</p>

<p>(2) Go to <a href="http://libre.adacore.com/download/configurations">http://libre.adacore.com/download/configurations</a> and, in the middle of the page, where it says &quot;Select your platform&quot;, choose &quot;x86-64 Mac OS X (64 bits)&quot; and &quot;GNAT GPL 2017&quot;.</p>

<p>(3) Expand the portion labeled &quot;GNAT Ada 2017&quot; and click on the link that says &quot;gnat-gpl-2017-x86_64-darwin-bin.tar.gz&quot; to download and save the file on your computer. Then, uncompress the downloaded file.</p>

<p>(4) In a shell (e.g. terminal or under emacs), navigate down into the resulting directory until you see the files README, doinstall, etc.&nbsp; Then, type,</p>

<p>sudo ./doinstall</p>

<p>You will be asked for the administrator password (which is likely just your password on your Mac).&nbsp; You should accept the default directory in which the files are to installed.</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp; Once the installation has completed (and the files are in /usr/local/gnat), you will need to add &quot;/usr/local/gnat/bin&quot; to the front of the PATH environment variable.&nbsp; To do this, you can put one of the following lines in your shell configuration files (e.g. .bashrc, .cshrc, etc.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PATH=/usr/local/gnat/bin:$PATH; export PATH&nbsp; (Bourne shell)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv PATH /usr/local/gnat/bin:$PATH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C shell)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Testing the compiler</strong></p>

<p>In the Ada resources folder, click on &quot;Simple Ada program to test compiler&quot;.&nbsp; A zip file will be downloaded.&nbsp; When you unzip it, you will see several files with .ads and .adb extensions.&nbsp; In a shell, go to the directory containing the files. Then type,</p>

<p>gnatmake&nbsp; objmain.adb</p>

<p>You will see that gcc is invoked several times, along with gnatbind and gnatlink.</p>

<p>To run the program, type</p>

<p>./objmain</p>

<p>(you won't need the &quot;./&quot; if your PATH environment variable contains &quot;.&quot;)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
