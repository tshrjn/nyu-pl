<TITLE>Ada Programming Assignment</TITLE>

<H1>Ada Programming Assignment<br><br></h1>
<h2>Due <u>Thursday, February 22</u></h2>
<br>
Please compress your code files into a zip file and upload it to our NYU Classes site. 
<br><br>
The sections of the <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/lovelace/master.htm">Lovelace Ada tutorial</a>
that you will find the most relevant are:
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/lovelace/lesson2.htm">Lesson 2 - Basic Ada Structure (Packages)</a>
<li>  <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/lovelace/lesson2.htm">Lesson 13 - Tasks and Protected Types</a>
</ul>
However, since you will need to declare types, implement procedures, etc., you should be sure to go through at least the following additional lessons in the Lovelace tutorial: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.
<br><br>
Also, be sure to review the sample Ada programs that I have provided under "Ada Resources" in the course page (also <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring18/CSCI-GA.2110-001/ada_programs/">here</a>).
<br><br>
<u><b>Assignment</b></u><br>
You will be implementing a program for reading in, sorting, summing, and printing an array of numbers, using concurrency.
<br><br>
Your program should consist of three files: MainProg.adb, Sorting.ads, and Sorting.adb as follows.
<br><br>
<u>MainProg.adb</u><br><br>

In the file MainProg.adb, write a procedure <tt>MainProg</tt> that performs the following.

<ul>   
<li>Read in 40 numbers into an array. Each number is an integer
between 0 and 500, inclusive. You should use a subtype of integer as the element
  type of the array to enforce this restriction.  Use Ada's <tt>Get</tt> procedure, as seen
  in the sample Ada programs, to read the numbers in from the standard input (the terminal).
  Do not read the numbes in from a file.
<br><br>

<li>
Create three tasks, <tt>PrintingTask</tt>, <tt>SortingTask</tt> and 
<tt>AddingTask</tt>, 
that run concurrently once the numbers have been read into the array.
These tasks perform the followng actions:
<ul>

<br>
<li><tt> PrintingTask</tt>:
<ul>
<li>First print out the elements of the array.

<li>Notify <tt>SortingTask</tt> that the numbers have been
printed.

<li>Wait for notification from <tt>SortingTask</tt> that it
is finished.

<li>Print out the elements of the array again.

<li>Wait to receive a value from <tt>AddingTask</tt>

<li>Print the value received from <tt>AddingTask</tt>
</ul>

<br>
<li>
<tt>AddingTask</tt>:
<ul>

<li> Wait for notification that <tt>SortingTask</tt>
is finished.

<li>Compute the sum of the elements of the sorted array.

<li>Send the result to <tt>PrintingTask</tt>.
</ul>

<br>
<li>
<tt>SortingTask</tt>:
<ul>
<li>Wait for notification that <tt>PrintingTask</tt>
has printed the elements of the array.

<li>Sort the array according to the parallel 
quicksort algorithm described below.

<li>Notify both <tt>PrintingTask</tt> and <tt>AddingTask</tt> that the
array is sorted.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<br><br>
<u>Sorting.ads</u> and <u>Sorting.adb</u><br><br>

In a separate package called <tt>Sorting</tt>, whose specification is
in the file Sorting.ads and whose body is in the file Sorting.adb, define
the procedure <tt>QSort(Low,High)</tt> for sorting those elements
of the above array between the <tt>Low</tt>'th element and the
<tt>High</tt>'th element, inclusive.

<br><br>

In <tt>Sorting.ads</tt>, the <tt>Sorting</tt> package specification, you should
declare the following:
<ul>
  <li> A constant <tt>SIZE</tt> that specifies the size of the array, namely 40. Elsewhere
    in your program, <tt>SIZE</tt> should be used, not 40, so that the size of the array
    can easily be changed without having to modify any other part of your program.
  <li> The type of the array, which must restrict the elements to be integers between 0
    and 500.
  <li> The array itself. By declaring the array in the package specification, it can be
    referenced within the tasks in MainProg as well as shared among the various calls to
    the <tt>QSort</tt> procedure.  This allows <tt>QSort</tt> to take only 
    <tt>Low</tt> and <tt>High</tt> as parameters, and not the array.
  <li> The <tt>QSort</tt> procedure.
</ul>


The <tt>QSort</tt> procedure should be implemented in <tt>Sorting.adb</tt>. The quicksort algorithm
can be described as follows (assuming the array is called <tt>A</tt>).
<ul>
<br>
<li>If <tt>Low</tt> is greater than or equal to <tt>High</tt>, then return.

<br><br>
<li>Otherwise, apply the routine <tt>Split</tt> to <tt>A</tt> as follows:
<ul>
<li>Declare a variable <tt>M</tt> and set it to the median value of the <tt>A(Low)</tt>,
<tt>A(High)</tt>, and <tt>A((Low+High)/2)</tt>. If there are only two elements of
<tt>A</tt> then assign to <tt>M</tt> the smaller of the two values.
<li>
Declare two variables <tt>I</tt> and <tt>J</tt>, setting <tt>I</tt> to <tt>Low</tt>
and <tt>J</tt> to <tt>High</tt>.

<li>
In a loop, as long as <tt>I</tt> is less than <tt>J</tt>, perform the following steps:
<ul>  
<li>
While <tt>A(I)</tt> is less than or equal to <tt>M</tt>, increment <tt>I</tt>.
<li> 
While <tt>A(J)</tt> is greater than <tt>M</tt>, decrement <tt>J</tt>.
<li>
If <tt>I</tt> is less than <tt>J</tt>, exchange the values of <tt>A(I)</tt> and <tt>A(J)</tt>.
</ul>
Make sure that <tt>I</tt> never becomes greater than <tt>J</tt>.
</ul> 

<br>
<li> 
At this point, the array <tt>A</tt> (between the Low and High elements, inclusive) has been
split into two parts. The first part of <tt>A</tt>
contains only numbers less than or equal to <tt>M</tt> and the second part of
<tt>A</tt> contains only numbers greater than <tt>M</tt>.  Call <tt>QSort</tt>
recursively on each of the two parts.  The two recursive calls should
occur <u>concurrently</u> and should share the array. 
</ul> 
<br>
Notice that by concurrently calling <tt>QSort</tt> recursively,
you will end up with many tasks executing concurrently.
<br>
</ul>

<br><br>

I recommend that you develop your program using the following steps:
<ol>
  <li> In the <tt>Sorting.ads</tt> file, declare <tt>SIZE</tt>, the array type, the array, and
    the <tt>QSort</tt> procedure.
  <li> In the <tt>Sorting.adb</tt> file, define a dummy version of <tt>Qsort</tt> that doesn't
    do anything.
   <li> In the <tt>MainProg.adb</tt> file, write and debug a procedure that reads
     in values into the array. Also write and debug a procedure that prints out the values of the
     array. The main procedure <tt>MainProg</tt> should call these two functions.
   <li> In the <tt>Sorting.adb</tt> file, write and debug a sequential (non-concurrent) version of
     <tt>QSort</tt>, replacing the dummy version. Call <tt>QSort</tt> from <tt>MainProg</tt>.
     <li> Write and debug the tasks (<tt>PrintingTask</tt>, <tt>SortingTask</tt> and 
       <tt>AddingTask</tt>) within <tt>MainProg</tt>.  <tt>SortingTask</tt>, of course, will
       be calling the sequential version of <tt>QSort</tt> at this point.
     <li> Modify the sequential version of <tt>QSort</tt> to make it concurrent, as specified
       above, and debug it.
  </ol>

<b><u>Important:</u> You must write all of the code yourself, without getting any code from the
Web, from another student, or any other source. If you get stuck, please email me at
goldberg@cs.nyu.edu and I will help.</b>
